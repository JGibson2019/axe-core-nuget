# Contribution Guidelines
Pull Requests should have a title that starts with a tag indicating the type of change. This helps us in maintaining a good commit history as well as better documentation when creating Release notes.

The convention that we follow is inspired from [SemVer](https://semver.org/) convention:

| Tag      | What it conveys                                                                                                                             |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| feat     | a commit of the type feat introduces a new feature in main or means completion of task towards a feature                                  |
| fix      | a commit of the type fix patches a bug or fixes a small known problem                                                                       |
| chore    | a commit of the type chore updates something in codebase without impacting any production code. eg: updating a grunt task etc.              |
| refactor | a commit of type refactor specifies a code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature but just refactors a portion of existing code |
| chore | a commit of type chore references a code change to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation |
