# Contribution Guidelines
Pull Requests should have a title that starts with a tag indicating the type of change. This helps us in maintaining a good commit history as well as better documentation when creating Release notes.

The convention that we follow is inspired from [SemVer](https://semver.org/) convention:

| Tag      | What it conveys                                                                                                                             |

| fix      | a commit of the type fix patches a bug or fixes a small known problem                                                                       |
| chore    | a commit of the type chore updates something in codebase without impacting any production code. eg: updating a grunt task etc.              |
